# LifeCharge Website

## Summary
Little side-project I did for a dear friend that resides in The Netherlands. Recently he had been playing with the idea of branching of his coaching company to have his own consultory. He already has this name for his new branding, and so him and I bounced some ideas back and forth trying to come up with the general tone and aesthetic of the site and the feel he wants to give clients when they visit this site for the first time.

## Design Process

1. He sketched with pencil and paper a wireframe idea on how he wanted the homepage to look like:

2. I recreated this idea on using Sketch and start building a mockup of the website. It was a very enjoyable experience using Sketch and I will for sure use it in the future to have a more solid idea on what I'm building.

3. After many back and forth sketches and feedback taken into account, we came up with this "final" mockup for the site:
