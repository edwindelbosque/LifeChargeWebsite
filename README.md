# LifeCharge
Creating Nick's website for Mod 0 Capstone project.
- This is a website I am building for my partner. A little more backstory:
- He has been working at a company for around 6 years as something similar to a life coach. 
Recently he has been playing with the idea of branching out with his momentum and have his own consultory.
- This is where I come in and think that maybe I could add a little meaning to my capstone project and start sketching
a blueprint for his future website. He wants to call it LifeCharge, and him and I have been throwing ideas back and forth
on how he wants his website to look like. A team effort.

1. He sketched with pencil and paper a very vague idea on how he wanted the homepage to look like:

2. I took this opportunity to install the app *Sketch* and start exploring the tools to make a mockup of the website. I have 
to say I really enjoyed using it and I will for sure use it in the future to have a more solid idea on how I want to code a website.

3. After many back and forth sketches and feedback taken into account, we came up with this "final" mockup for the website:

4. I started coding.
